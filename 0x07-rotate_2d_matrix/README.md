# ROTATE A MATRIX - PYTHON 
This folder contains code for rotating a 2D matrix 90deg Clockwise.
Check it out

## PROBLEM
Given an `n` x `n` 2D matrix, rotate it 90 degrees clockwise.  

- Prototype: `def rotate_2d_matrix(matrix):`  
- Function should return nothing. The matrix must be edited **in-place**.  
- The matrix can be assumed to have 2 dimensions and will not be empty.  

Check my implementation in the file **_0-rotate_2d_matrix.py_**
